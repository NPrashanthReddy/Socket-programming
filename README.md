# Socket-programming

The folder contains the two required files server.py to run the server code and client.py to run the client code.
We also added few test files such as a .gif, .png and a .txt so as to demonstrate the file transfer mechanism.

## Instructions
- We have to dowload the server.py and client.py file to begin working with the project (the additional files can also be downloaded for checking).
- We have to first run the server.py file using the command "python server.py".
- We can then create any number of clients , by running client.py file the required number of times using the command "python client.py"
